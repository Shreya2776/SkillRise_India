## 📌 The Problem

> **Millions of capable workers in India are left behind — not due to lack of skill, but lack of structured guidance.**

India's workforce is vast and diverse, yet the career-tech ecosystem almost exclusively serves white-collar IT professionals. The ground-level reality is stark:

- 🔴 Blue-collar workers have **no structured platform** for upskilling or job discovery
- 🔴 Grey-collar professionals (technicians, healthcare aides, retail workers) are **invisible to modern job platforms**
- 🔴 Students from Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities face a **massive guidance vacuum**
- 🔴 Existing tools cannot handle **non-standard career paths** or regional nuances
- 🔴 Resume tools and interview coaches are designed **only for corporate, English-first profiles**

---

## 💡 Solution Overview

**SkillRise India** is a full-stack, AI-driven career platform that serves *every* Indian worker — regardless of education, language, or collar color.

It combines the power of **Large Language Models**, **semantic vector search**, and **multi-agent orchestration** to deliver hyper-personalized career guidance at scale. From a construction worker seeking a foreman certification to a nursing student preparing for interviews — SkillRise adapts to you.

## ✨ Core Features

<details>
<summary><strong>🤖 AI Career Chatbot (Multi-Agent System)</strong></summary>

<br/>

A LangGraph-orchestrated, context-aware chatbot that remembers your profile, past conversations, and career goals. Unlike generic bots, it routes your queries to specialized sub-agents:

- **Career Advisor Agent** — Long-term roadmap planning
- **Job Search Agent** — Targeted opportunity matching via vector search
- **Skill Coach Agent** — Gap analysis and course recommendations
- **Interview Prep Agent** — Domain-specific question generation

It uses **Hybrid Memory** — combining MongoDB (structured history) with Pinecone (semantic recall) — to deliver responses that feel like talking to a knowledgeable mentor, not a chatbot.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🎯 Smart Job & Opportunity Recommendations</strong></summary>

<br/>

An intelligent recommendation feed that doesn't just match keywords — it understands *context*. Powered by Sentence Transformer embeddings and Pinecone, it surfaces:

- Localized job openings (city/state-aware)
- NGO-run training camps and career drives
- Government skill development programs
- Upskilling courses ranked by relevance to your current profile

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>📄 Resume Analyzer</strong></summary>

<br/>

Upload your resume and receive:

- An **ATS compatibility score** (0–100) benchmarked against industry standards
- A precise list of **missing keywords** for your target role
- Section-by-section **actionable improvements**
- Suggestions tailored for blue-collar and grey-collar formats — not just IT profiles

Supports PDF and DOCX formats.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🎙️ Real-Time Mock Interview Engine</strong></summary>

<br/>

An interactive Voice/Text AI agent that conducts live mock interviews:

- Dynamically adapts questions based on your **live answers**
- Covers both **technical** and **behavioral** dimensions
- Provides instant, structured **feedback reports**
- Supports domain-specific tracks (trades, healthcare, hospitality, IT, retail, etc.)

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>📊 Skill Gap Analyzer</strong></summary>

<br/>

Maps your current skill profile against target job requirements and outputs:

- A **visual skill gap heatmap**
- Ranked list of skills to acquire (by impact)
- Recommended resources for each gap (courses, NGOs, YouTube, etc.)

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🏢 NGO Ecosystem & Dashboard</strong></summary>

<br/>

A dedicated portal where verified NGOs can:

- Post career camps, training drives, and skill programs
- Target postings by region, skill category, and user profile
- View engagement analytics for their posted opportunities

All NGO content is surfaced in the main recommendation feed for relevant users.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🏛️ Government Admin Panel</strong></summary>

<br/>

A secure, role-based administration interface where government administrators can:

- Verify and register NGOs on the platform
- Monitor NGO activity and impact metrics across states
- Manage platform-level configurations

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>📱 Personalized Dashboard</strong></summary>

<br/>

Every user gets a dynamic home dashboard showing:

- Recommended jobs and opportunities (updated in real-time)
- Resume health score and improvement suggestions
- Upcoming NGO events nearby
- Progress tracking on skill roadmaps

</details>

## 🤖 How AI Works in This Project

### 1. Personalization Engine Flow

```
User Profile + History
        │
        ▼
Sentence Transformer Embeddings
        │
        ▼
Pinecone Vector Search ──► Top-K Semantic Matches
        │
        ▼
Groq LLM (Llama 3) ──► Re-ranked, Profile-Aware Response
        │
        ▼
Personalized Feed / Recommendation
```

Every interaction refines the user's vector profile. The system learns your preferences — without ever needing explicit ratings or form fills.

### 2. Agentic Chatbot Architecture

<img src="screenshots/agentic_chatbot_architecture.png" alt="Agentic Chatbot Architecture Flowchart" width="100%"/>

### 3. Hybrid Memory & Semantic Search

| Memory Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Short-term | In-memory (session) | Active conversation context |
| Structured | MongoDB | User profiles, chat logs, NGO data |
| Semantic | Pinecone + Sentence Transformers | Long-term recall, job/course matching |

The combination allows the chatbot to recall *what you said three weeks ago* as naturally as what you said three messages ago — essential for ongoing career journeys that span months.

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Frontend** | React.js, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion | Fast, animated, responsive UI |
| **Backend** | Node.js, Express.js | API routing, authentication, business logic |
| **Primary Database** | MongoDB, Mongoose | User profiles, chat logs, NGO/Admin data |
| **Vector Database** | Pinecone | Semantic search, long-term memory |
| **Embeddings** | Sentence Transformers | Text → vector conversion for search |
| **LLM Inference** | Groq API (Llama 3) | Ultra-fast language model responses |
| **AI Orchestration** | LangGraph | Multi-agent routing and state management |
| **Auth** | JWT + RBAC Middleware | Secure, role-based access control |
